# SentimentAnalysis4RW
SentimentAnalysis4RW is a project for stock market predictions using stock tweets of Twitter.   Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.
Tweepy: tweepy is the python client for the official Twitter API.
Install it using following pip command:
pip install tweepy

TextBlob: textblob is the python library for processing textual data.
Install it using following pip command:
pip install textblob

Also, we need to install some NLTK corpora using following command:
python -m textblob.download_corpora
(Corpora is nothing but a large and structured set of texts.)
